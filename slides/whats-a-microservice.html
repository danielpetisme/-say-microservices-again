<h2>What's a Microservice</h2>

<p>
  <!--Gather the functionalities by <span class="highlight">Business Capabilities</span> into separated processes and make them talk to-->
  <!--each other.-->
  <!--<br/>-->
  <!--<img src="resources/microservices.png" alt="Microservices"/>-->
  <!--<br/>-->
  <!--Communicate using either synchronous protocols such as HTTP or asynchronous protocols such as AMQP.-->
  <!--<br/><br/>-->
  <!--Developed and deployed independently of one another.-->
<blockquote class="text-left" cite="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">
  In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a <span
    class="highlight">suite of
  small services</span>, each running in its <span class="highlight">own process</span> and <span class="highlight">communicating with lightweight
  mechanisms</span>, often an HTTP resource API.<br/>
  These services are built <span class="highlight">around business
  capabilities</span> and <span class="highlight">independently deployable</span> (...).<br/>

<i>TL;DR</i>
</br/>
Loosely coupled service oriented architecture<br/>with bounded contexts.
